# Particle Filters (Sequential Monte Carlo) for Finance Tracking

This project demonstrates how Particle Filters can be used to estimate
hidden trends in financial time series. The implementation is written
entirely in Python and includes visualization and synthetic data
generation.

## Features
- Fully working Particle Filter in Python
- No mathematical formulas required
- Visualization of observed prices, true trend, and estimated trend
- Supports replacement of synthetic data with actual stock prices
- Lightweight and easy to run

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the script:
   python particle_filter_finance.py

3. Modify the input to use real financial market data if desired.

## Use Cases
- Trend estimation in noisy markets  
- Volatility tracking  
- Regime-shift detection  
- Risk monitoring  

This project is ideal for educational, research, and applied finance scenarios.
